## 🚫 **Deployment**
Currently, the application has not been deployed. To run the project locally, you need to download and execute **both the front-end and back-end repositories**.

### ▶ **How to Run the Project (Front-End and Back-End)**
To clone and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repositories (front-end and back-end)**:
   - Front-end:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/navsegura/navegacaosegura
     ```
   - Back-end:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/navsegura/navegacaosegura-backend
     ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the project folders and install the dependencies for both the front-end and back-end:
     ```bash
     cd front-end/naveguardFront/src
     npm install
     ```
     ```bash
     cd back-end/naveguard
     npm install
     ```

3. **Run the front-end**:
   - After installing the dependencies, use the command below to run the front-end:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

4. **Run the back-end**:
   - In another terminal tab, navigate to the back-end folder and start the server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```


## 🧪 **Testing**
You can test the application in two ways:
- **Manually**: Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to test the routes listed above.
- **Automated**: Once the deployment is complete.

Below are examples of test scenarios:

<div align="center"> 
  <h3>List all tutorials (GET)</h3>
  <img src="" width="600px">
 
  <h3>Retrieve tutorial by ID (GET)</h3>
  <img src="" width="600px">

  <h3>Update tutorial by ID (PUT)</h3>
  <img src="" width="600px">
  
  <h3>Create tutorial (POST)</h3>
  <img src="" width="600px">
</div>


## 📅 **Conclusion**
"NaveGuard" combines entertainment and education with a strong focus on interactive games. This gamified approach, combined with features involving both parents and children, creates a unique experience that is hard for competitors to replicate. The platform not only educates but also entertains, ensuring greater adherence to the content.

A significant improvement for future development would be implementing a real database to store information, replacing the current mocked data. This would allow for greater scalability, security, and flexibility in data management, as well as a more robust experience for platform users.
